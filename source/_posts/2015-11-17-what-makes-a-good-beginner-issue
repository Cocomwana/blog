In the days leading up to our 24 Pull Requests event, a day of helping beginner coders get started in contributing to open source software, we asked our coaches and the general public to submit good, beginner friendly issues they found on Github for our students to work on during the event. The most common question we get is what constitutes a good beginner issue? The question is valid, especially from the perspective of a seasoned developer who can make sense of very specific jargon and can understand other developers intentions from a few words and crude sentences. That isn’t so for a complete beginner. As someone who was a beginner - some would say still is - just a few short months ago and is also one of the maintainers of an open source project, I think I can give some tips on what kind of issues helped me get started in open source and what kind of issues might suite other beginners.

**Small bugs, or very small features**

As a beginner it is important to start with small, succinct tasks. Things that can be solved in a day or so, maybe even in an hour. Remember, when you are a beginner, contributing to open source isn’t only about fixing the bug but everything else that comes with the process: forking the repo, cloning it, setting it up, finding the bug, fixing it, adding, committing, pushing, opening the PR and so. This might mean relinquishing some control of your project and offering up quick fixes and small features to potential contributors. Yes, you might be able to fix that little bug in 2 seconds yourself and never think about it again, but for a beginner that 2 second bug might be the issue that sets them off on a journey of contributing to open source.

**Issues with a clear context**

We’ve all seen issues on Github with a non-descriptive title like ‘remove no-js tags with js’. No description, no context. This in principal sounds like something a beginner with very little Javascript knowledge could do, detect whether an element has a no-js class and consequently remove it, but the lack of context makes it almost impossible to understand what the actual issue is. A good beginner issue has a clear description and gives as much guidance as possible without actually solving the issue. You are a project maintainer and might have an idea where in the project the bug might lie? Good, include the partial you think the bug might be coming from. You have a visual representation of the issue? Great, include a screenshot of it. The more details the better.

**Projects with a setup guide**

Not once have I found an issue on Github I deemed solvable with my limited skills only to find out the project has no setup instructions. As I mentioned in the first point, setting up the project itself is one of the most daunting parts of starting to contribute to open source. I have personally abandoned several projects because I got stuck while setting up the local dev environment and deemed the effort of reaching out to the maintainer or figuring it out on my own too much. If you want people to contribute to your project please take the time to write clear and detailed setup instructions.

**Responsive project maintainers**

It can be extremely discouraging to finally open that first PR you’ve worked so hard on to then not hear from the maintainer for weeks, sometimes even months. We at codebar are guilty of this too. It is hard to always be up to date on a project from a maintainers point of view, but it is extremely important for a beginner to get prompt feedback on their PR. Don’t be afraid to give feedback. If you don’t like the design they did for example, or want them to refactor some code, let them know in a respectful and objective way. The key is clear and respectful communication and collaboration.

**It's not only about code**

This has been said many times but code is not the only way to contribute to an open source project. Think about all the other components that make up a project: documentation, visual design, UX, user testing, accessibility, etc. These are all components of your project that you can open up to the community. But don’t over do it either. I’ve seen many, many issue that simply stated 'write documentation'. How would a beginner who relies on documentation more than anything know where to start with that? Instead write a rough draft of the documentation and ask people to contribute to that.

**Conclusion**

All this means that project maintainers have to put in the time to create issues that are clear and understandable even for non-developers. It means they have to aid and help out beginners to contribute to open source projects. It might mean holding someone’s hand in fixing their first issue and submitting their first PR on the project. Yes, this take time and effort, but it’s the only way to build a community of willing participants around a project and to get more people involved in open source.
