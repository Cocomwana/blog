The aim of this post is to clear up some confusion regarding the East London and South London codebar workshops. 

As a coach or student, you have to sign up to the workshops seperately via the website. This means if you want to go on the East London workshop, sign up to this one. This means you will not receive invites for the South London workshop, and vice-versa. If you want to attend both workshops, you need to sign up to them seperately. This will mean you will start receiving invites for both London workshops. BUT, please do not then confirm attendance for both if they are on the same day. We do not have time to go through names and remove you from a list. So please bare this in mind when confirming your attendance for a workshop.

On another note we have been nominated for Grassroots Event of the Year award at the net awards. This is an amazing achievement for us as it is nominated by you. So if you have a spare 10 seconds please ([vote for us](https://thenetawards.com/vote/grassroots/codebar/)).
