	<section class="post-excerpt">
		<p>On Saturday 4th June we organised Mind the Code, a day dedicated to mindfulness. Our aim was to run a slightly different event to anything we have ever ran before, where the day consisted of talks, workshops and yoga.</p>

<p>The day began with a few lightning talks from all of our sponsors and the first main talk of the day by <a href="https://twitter.com/emilyatk">Emily Atkinson</a>, developer and product manager at <a href="http://uk.moo.com">Moo</a>. Emily’s talk focused on coding mindfully. The first half of her talk focused on viewing code as a means to solving a problem. She discussed that as a developer you do not sit down to ‘write code’, you sit down to solve a problem. The second half of her talk was trying to get the audience to think about how other people view your code, and compared this to the foundations of a house. You want a solid base so that other developers can jump into the project and build upon your code without ruining your previous work.</p>

<p><a href=""><img src="/images/MTC-EmilyAtkinson.jpg" alt="Mind the code - Emily Atkinson" /></a></p>

<p>The second part to the day was an exercise on domain modelling. Students and coaches were paired up randomly and asked to design a new system for managing the London Tube system. Using paper and pens, we asked them to think about the concepts behind this model, classes, and who would be responsible for these classes and the relationship between them.</p>

<p><a href=""><img src="/images/MTC-Exercise1.jpg" alt="Mind the Code - Exercise 1" /></a></p>

<p>Once the first half of the day was completed, the first Yoga session was taken by Sandrine. This was then followed by lunch, provided by <a href="http://pronto.co.uk">Pronto</a>.</p>

<p>Next began our main coding workshop. The task here was to pick one of our set <a href="https://github.com/deniseyu/mind-the-code/tree/master/projects">projects</a> and begin building it with their coaches. The projects included a yoga slot machine, yoga lullabies, yoga pose name generator, online mode ring and a to-do list. The aim of this workshop was to get the students started on a projects of their choice.</p>

<p>We then had a second yoga workshop, for those that did not do it the first time, followed by the afternoon session of lightning talks. The <a href="http://slides.com/kimberleycook/motivation#/">first lightning talk</a> was by <a href="https://twitter.com/kimberleycook91">Kimberley Cook</a>, codebar organiser and front-end/iOS developer at Pixeled Eggs, on motivation. The <a href="http://gylippus.github.io/lightening-hybrid/#/">second lightning talk</a> was by <a href="https://twitter.com/heryandotus">Ryan Hanna</a>, mobile developer at Sworkit, on building hybrid apps with HMTL/CSS and JS. And the <a href="http://slides.com/alexpeattie/love#/">final talk</a> was by <a href="https://twitter.com/alexpeattie">Alex Peattie</a>, CTO at Peg, on developing mindful code regardless of your level.</p>

<p><a href=""><img src="/images/MTC-lightning-talk.jpg" alt="Mind the Code - Alex Peattie" /></a></p>

<p>After the lightning talks we had the second part to the coding workshop, which was a continuation of the first workshop. We stressed that the projects did not need to be finished as the workshop was more about what it means to develop software, and to have fun building it too.</p>

<p>We want to say a huge thanks to all of our sponsors <a href="http://mailjet.com">MailJet</a>, <a href="http://shutl.com/uk">Shutl</a>, <a href="https://www.twilio.com">Twilio</a> and <a href="http://beta.makersacademy.com">Makers Academy</a>. Also a huge thank you to <a href="https://twitter.com/MintSugar">Michela Tannoia</a> for designing our stickers. Without all of your support the day would not have been possible. And a final big thank you to all the students and coaches who attended and made our first Mind the Code an absolute blast.</p>

	<section class="post-excerpt">
		<p>The aim of this post is to clear up some confusion regarding the East London and South London codebar workshops.</p>

<p>As a coach or student, you have to sign up to the workshops seperately via the website. This means if you want to go on the East London workshop, sign up to this one. This means you will not receive invites for the South London workshop, and vice-versa. If you want to attend both workshops, you need to sign up to them seperately. This will mean you will start receiving invites for both London workshops. BUT, please do not then confirm attendance for both if they are on the same day. We do not have time to go through names and remove you from a list. So please bear this in mind when confirming your attendance for a workshop.</p>

<p>On another note we have been nominated for Grassroots Event of the Year award at the net awards. This is an amazing achievement for us as it is nominated by you. So if you have a spare 10 seconds please (<a href="https://thenetawards.com/vote/grassroots/codebar/">vote for us</a>).</p>

				Clojurebridge London</a>
		</h2>
	</header>
	<section class="post-excerpt">
		<p>On Saturday April 18, Kriszta, Jarkyn, and Denise took part in London&rsquo;s first-ever <a href="www.clojurebridge.org">Clojurebridge</a> workshop, hosted at uSwitch&rsquo;s sunny offices in Southwark. We learned TONS of Clojure &ndash; our brains were mush by the end of the day! &ndash; and were able to experience how a workshop can successfully cater for many different experience levels. The students participating in the workshop came from all different backgrounds. Some were full-time developers looking to pick up some functional programming as a hobby; others were newcomers to coding altogether.</p>

<p>As newcomers to functional programming, we quickly realized that we would need to think about problem-solving in a completely different way if we were to become good Clojure developers. Unlike object-oriented languages such as Ruby or Javascript (most of the time..), functions are first-class citizens in Clojure &ndash; quite literally, because the function precedes each list. Because objects don&rsquo;t exist in the same way as Ruby objects, they can&rsquo;t hold state. As a result, data passed into a Clojure function is processed in a consistent, predictable way. Clojure can also developed with fast feedback cycles because it is richly supported by instant REPLs in several editors. An interesting side effect of this is that, while Test Driven Development (TDD) has many evangelists in Ruby and Java communities, TDD did not seem to have the same following in the Clojure community.</p>

<p>We worked our way through the Clojurebridge tutorials relatively quickly, then spent lots of time experimenting with our new skills. We wired together a basic web API and practiced making requests to some public APIs, which is where Clojure really steps up to bat. I was sold on Clojure when I saw how elegantly and efficiently you can traverse an HTTP response.</p>

<p>But, a blog post on Clojurebridge would be incomplete without a shoutout to the amount of hospitality we received! The organisers, sponsors, and hosts made sure there was no chance of us going hungry at any point. A constant stream of bagels, fruit, cheese, sandwiches, coffee, tea, and beer kept us caffeinated and energized. Codebar has to step up our game now&hellip; :)</p>

<p>For anyone interested in learning Clojure, there are a wealth of resources online. Here are a small handful of them:</p>

	<section class="post-excerpt">
		<p>Last Wednesday saw 24 students and 12 coaches attend the first ever South London Codebar at <a href="https://www.pactcoffee.com">Pact Coffee HQ</a>. The structure of the event was the same as normal, a lightning talk followed by a 2 hour workshop, this time just south of the River Thames.</p>

<p>The lightning talk was given by Tony To, tech lead at Pact Coffee, about&hellip; you guessed it Pact Coffee. He gave us an insight into what life is like at Pact and the journey the coffee goes through, from delivery to their HQ to distribution to customers. He also gave us a little introduction into the tech that Pact Coffee use to maintain their website and app, and how a Raspberry Pi powers their distribution printer.</p>

<p><a href=""><img src="/images/tony-sl-talk.jpg" alt="Tony To" /></a></p>

<p>Then as normal students and coaches were matched up for the 2 hour workshop.</p>

<p><a href=""><img src="/images/pact-coffee.jpg" alt="Pact Coffee" /></a></p>

<p>We would like to thank Pact Coffee for donating their venue for this event. And another huge thank you to Hire Space for their generous donation towards this event.</p>

<p>Without the generous donations of both <a href="https://www.pactcoffee.com">Pact</a> and <a href="https://hirespace.com">Hire Space</a> this event would not have happened. If you are a company in South London and would like to sponsor an event, or donate your venue for the evening, then please get in contact at <a href="mailto:south-london@codebar.io">south-london@codebar.io</a></p>

				Kickstart Your Development Career</a>
		</h2>
	</header>
	<section class="post-excerpt">
		<p>On the 16th of March a small group of aspiring developers came together at the <a href="https://gocardless.com/">GoCardless</a> offices in London for an evening event on how to <a href="http://codebar.io/courses/kickstart-your-developer-career">Kickstart Your Development Career</a>. The workshop, run by <a href="https://twitter.com/alinajaf">Najaf Ali</a>, was a three hour long presentation filled with practical knowledge and helpful tips on how to get your first job in web development.</p>

<p><a href=""><img src="/images/kickstart-your-dev-career.jpg" alt="Kickstart your dev career" /></a></p>

<p>The workshop consisted of three 30 minute sessions, each elaborating on a critical part of starting a career in web development.</p>

<p>In part one, Ali explained how to build tech skills and what to learn as an aspiring developer. The main takeaway from this section was to focus on one specific language (be it Ruby or Python or Javascript) or web development topic. Learning through printed books is still one of the best ways to gain strong knowledge of a language. Another key learning point was not to be put off by the less visually welcoming stuff: it is important to learn how to use the command line, to understand how Git works, and to get familiar with concepts like control structures, algorithms and relational databases such as MySQL. These skills will become increasingly important later on in your career. As a way of measuring skills, Ali suggested building lots of small projects, quantity over quality being key. Seeing what you can build from scratch without checking the internet for reference is also a good way to understand how much you actually know.</p>

<p>In part two Ali gave us tips on how to build influence and create a network in the tech industry. Going to meet ups and conferences is an excellent way to meet new people. Even better is talking at these events as these appearances can position you as an expert on a certain topic. Another way to build influence is to write a blog. Don&rsquo;t be afraid of coming off as an amateur - even the most basic piece of information can be useful to someone just getting into development. Another important point from this section was to have a couple of your best projects - around 2 to 3 - online and in a state where you can show them off to prospective employers at a moment&rsquo;s notice. And finally, on your personal website clearly state that you are available for work if that is the case.</p>

<p>Part three was concerned with the actual process of getting a job. Once again, we received a lot of useful tips from how to find job openings (it&rsquo;s always best if they come to you) to what to put on your CV. The most important lesson from this section was to have a plan: know what type of company you want to work for and target them specifically. Be confident in your skills and in your worth. Finally, be interested in the company and job you are applying for - genuine enthusiasm for the position and the company goes a long way.</p>

<p>All in all it was a very informative and helpful evening for the newbie programmers in attendance. If you are an aspiring developer keen on getting your first job in the industry or if you are one of the attendees and want to revisit the content of the workshop you can get the <a href="http://www.happybearsoftware.com/kickstart-your-developer-career">Kickstart Your Developer Career</a> book by signing up to <a href="http://www.happybearsoftware.com/kickstart-your-developer-career">this</a> mailing list.</p>

				Bath Ruby Conference 2015</a>
		</h2>
	</header>
	<section class="post-excerpt">
		<p>If you happened to be in Bath last Friday, 13th of March, you would have seen a host of Ruby developers from the UK and beyond descend upon the ancient city for the first ever <a href="http://2015.bathruby.org/">Bath Ruby Conference</a> held at the Assembly Halls (chandeliers and all!). Such a fantastic event could not be missed, so went along for a full day of talks, learning and socialising.</p>

<p><a href="http://2015.bathruby.org/index.html"><img src="/images/bath-ruby-logo.png" alt="Bath Ruby Conference 2015" /></a></p>

<p><a href=""><img src="/images/bathruby-intro.jpg" alt="codebar organisers at Bath Ruby" /></a></p>

<p>Let me tell you, we had an amazing time! We met some of our coding heroes, most notably Sandi Metz, Katrina Owens, Ben Orenstein and Saron Yitbarek (yes, she is equally as nice in real life as she is on the <a href="http://www.codenewbie.org/">CodeNewbies</a> podcasts). We talked to amazing developers (both novice and more experienced), listened to some truly inspiring talks and had the opportunity to introduce <a href="http://codebar.io/">Codebar</a> on stage to the 500 strong crowd. We enjoyed an all together lovely, thought provoking day in the beautiful city of Bath.</p>

<p>No conference would be what it is without and excellent lineup of speakers (commendably 4/6 speakers were female) and topics, some of the highlights for us included:</p>

<p>Saron Yitbarek (<a href="https://twitter.com/saronyitbarek">@saronyitbarek</a>) spoke about the importance of supporting each other as you learn to code and develop as a novice programmer, because for those who don&rsquo;t get started at university or a bootcamp, it can be difficult to stay motivated when learning independently. In addition, she emphasized the importance of reading codebases written by other people &ndash; whether or not that code is &ldquo;good&rdquo; code &ndash; as one of the fastest ways to grow as a developer.</p>

<p>Katrina Owen (<a href="https://twitter.com/kytrinyx">@kytrinx</a>), the founder of <a href="http://www.exercism.io">exercism.io</a>, gave a talk on legacy code and the choices developers face on a daily basis: whether what you are contributing is actually moving the project forward or holding it back. She offered an explanation using Game Theory as to why developers (even good developers) will occasionally write bad code, which was extremely interesting, and perhaps a little bit too true for any developer in the audience who had worked with legacy code!</p>

<p>Tom Stuart&rsquo;s (<a href="https://twitter.com/tomstuart">@tomstuart</a>) talk wove many disparate concepts together into a talk about mathematical abstraction in software development. Using disarmingly simple slides, he explained how a concept as seemingly straightforward as bartering apples and bananas can be abstracted and applied to writing complex pieces of code. However, he emphasized that not all abstraction is good &ndash; abstraction is an effective means to an end when it is honest and minimal.</p>

<p>And finally Sandi Metz&rsquo;s (<a href="https://twitter.com/sandimetz">@sandimetz</a>) talk on nothing, and how sometimes nothing IS something. Her presentation featured an enormous diversity of Ruby topics, from metaprogramming to polymorphism to slightly off beat concepts like monkey-patching the Nil class. Although geared towards more advanced programmers, she ensured that new programmers in the room could access her insights on object-oriented Ruby.</p>

<p>We would like to thank the Bath Ruby organisers for putting together such an excellent event and for letting us spread the Codebar word. They did an excellent job - creating a friendly, inclusive, diverse and inspiring event. We&rsquo;ll definitely be back next year for another round of amazing talks and general merriment.</p>
